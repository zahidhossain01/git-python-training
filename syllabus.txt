GIT:
Installing Git (set PATH)
creating/initializing repo locally
linking to upstream (GitHub) - also show how VSCode makes this really easy
git status
git log (--oneline --nograph?)
diff concepts
branches, merging branches
pull requests (from branch, but also from fork?)

* side thing, installing Oh-My-Posh for git status theme stuff
* fun for side reading later notes if curious: semantic versioning (https://semver.org/)

PYTHON:
installing python (set PATH)

script vs module (if __name__ == "__main__")
    python -m vs python
    py vs python vs python3 command

everything is a label/object
objects
datatypes: int, float, str, list, dict, tuple (+ etc like bytes I guess?)
control: while, for, break, continue
    iterators (explain what range(n) really does)
    basic "for i in range" and then "for thing in (iterator)" and "for t1,t2 in iterator", also showing that "for (t1,t2) in iterator" is same as no parentheses
    also the "for _ in iterator"
    list comprehension
operators: / vs //, ^^ vs ^, bitwise operators vs logical operators (! vs not) - also operator precedence but not super important
classes: constructors, self, inheritance
